Cake is a 32 bit (with future plans for 64 bit expansion) hobby operating system started by me [lukem95](lukem95.md). It is written in C, ASM and C++.

# About #

Welcome to the **CakeOS** google code page. Cake is still in its Alpha stage, with development being fairly slow, as other hobbys/work/school are taking their toll on my free time. Expect updates to be posted here :)

Please see the Wiki for specification and other information on the project.

**Please note that this project has been discontinued.**
