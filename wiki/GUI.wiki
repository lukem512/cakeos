#The GUI related ideas

= Ideas =

The GUI will be fairly usual, for the most part. It will aim to be a more user-oriented version of a windows or linux GUI, but with additional features.

+ Widgets - behind the application windows, on the Desktop
+ "Start Bar" always visible (but hideable with a button) at top left
+ Ability to section off areas of the screen, to have multiple desktops
+ Ability to skin everything (or a lot of stuff)
+ Multiple virtual desktops (with ability to assign them to a monitor)

= Things To Note =

+ Colours will be very different and contrasting (for poor sighted people)
+ Colours for "cancel" and "ok" buttons, etc, will always be the same
