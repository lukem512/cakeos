#summary Driver ideas and design
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Cake is a modular monolithic kernel, and as such needs a way for drivers to be hot-plugged into the kernel.

Several of the drivers need to be available at boot-time however, in order to load the other drivers. Drivers should be available for download, where they can be placed in a folder in the .img or .iso file, or where they can be loaded during run time.

The drivers that need to be available as GRUB modules (from boot) are:
 * (S)ATA
 * Floppy Driver Controller (For legacy)
 * CD/DVD (ATAPI)
 * FAT12 FS
 * RAM FS

The other drivers can be loaded from the boot medium in a /sys/drv folder.


= Driver Interface =

Drivers need to comply to a common interface.

Once loaded they will call a syscall with a pointer to the driver structure in memory. This structure has the locations of specific driver functions.

Required functions are:
 * IOCTL
 * INIT
 * DEINIT
 * OPEN
 * CLOSE

Optional functions are:
 * READ
 * WRITE

code i might need for ideas:

enum devtype { Block, Char };

typedef struct device_ops {
	int		 (*open)	(struct device *device, int flags);
	int		 (*close)	(struct device *device);
	ssize_t		 (*read)	(struct device *device, void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
	ssize_t		 (*write)	(struct device *device, const void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
	int		 (*stat)	(struct device *device, struct stat *statbuf);
	struct vm_page	*(*mmap)	(struct device *device, off_t offset);
	int		 (*ioctl)	(struct device *device, int request, char *argp);
} device_ops_t;

/* Defines a device */
typedef struct device {
	list_t header;
	const char *name;

	refcount_t count;
	enum devtype type;

	device_ops_t *ops;
	void *data;
} device_t;
